RAW      -[#D32F2F,bold]-> FEAT     : Privacy & Compliance Risk\n(e.g., PII handling, consent)
FEAT     -[#F57C00,bold]-> TRAIN    : Bias Amplification Risk\n(e.g., skewed features, unrepresentative data)
TRAIN    -[#FBC02D,bold]-> REG_CICD : Lineage & Reproducibility Risk\n(e.g., untracked experiments, opaque models)
REG_CICD -[#FBC02D,bold]-> SERVE    : Unsafe Promotion Risk\n(e.g., inadequately validated model)
SERVE    -[#D32F2F,bold]-> MON      : Operational & Performance Drift Risk\n(e.g., accuracy decay, latency spikes)
MON      -[#F57C00,bold]-> REG_CICD : Ineffective Response Risk\n(e.g., delayed rollback, missed drift signals)

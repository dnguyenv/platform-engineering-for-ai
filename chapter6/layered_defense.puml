EXT_USER --> PERIMETER_GATEWAY
PERIMETER_GATEWAY --> SERVICE_MESH : (Authorized & Filtered Traffic)
SERVICE_MESH --> NETWORK_POLICY : (Network Policies\n Enforced by CNI)
NETWORK_POLICY --> RUNTIME_SECURITY : (Applies to individual\n Pods/Containers)

RUNTIME_SECURITY --> SECRETS_MGMT : (Workloads securely \nfetch secrets)
SERVICE_MESH --> MODEL_DEFENSES : (Requests to \nModel Inference Endpoints)
MODEL_DEFENSES --> SECRETS_MGMT : (e.g., for model \ndecryption keys if applicable)


PERIMETER_GATEWAY --> SIEM : (Edge Logs, WAF Alerts)
SERVICE_MESH --> SIEM : (Service Comm. \nLogs, AuthZ Events)
NETWORK_POLICY --> SIEM : (Network Flow Logs, \nPolicy Denial Events)
RUNTIME_SECURITY --> SIEM : (Container/Host \nSecurity Events, Audit Logs)
SECRETS_MGMT --> SIEM : (Secret Access Audit Logs)
MODEL_DEFENSES --> SIEM : (Model Anomaly Alerts, \nInput Validation Logs)

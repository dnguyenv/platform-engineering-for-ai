queue "CI/CD System\n(e.g., on PR/commit,\nscheduled run)" as CI_RUNNER
rectangle "Data Quality\nGate" as DQ_GATE
rectangle "Feature Sanity\nGate" as FS_GATE
rectangle "Model Validation\nGate (Performance, Fairness, Robustness)" as MV_GATE

rectangle "CD Promotion Gate\n(Security Scans, Ops Checks, Final Review)" as CD_GATE

CI_RUNNER -right-> DQ_GATE : Triggers
DQ_GATE --> FS_GATE   : On Pass
FS_GATE --> MV_GATE   : On Pass
MV_GATE -left-> REGISTRY  : On Pass (Registers/Updates \nModel Candidate)
REGISTRY --> CD_GATE  : On Promotion Event \n(e.g., from 'staging' to 'prod-candidate')
CD_GATE --> PROD_DEPLOY: On Pass (Deploys to Production)

note bottom of MV_GATE
  If any gate (DQ, FS, MV) fails:
  - Pipeline halts
  - Artifact tagged 'rejected'
  - Logs to governance dashboard
